#### Create an update script in real time.

The next release of Postgres Compare includes a new "Create Script" experience which allows you to work with and make alterations to an update script in real time. Previously this was a small modal. Now it is a seperate, resizable window to make it easier to work with and include some extra information.

The changes generated by Postgres Compare are listed in the changes panel to the left of the window. Clicking on each change shows a side by side diff of the related object and highlights the SQL in the script panel on the right. Changes can be included or excluded before saving.
