The PostgresCompare CLI is a planned feature that will allow you to run comparisons and generate deployment scripts from the command line.

## Coming Soon

The CLI is currently under development and is not yet available. When released, it will enable:

- Running schema comparisons from the terminal
- Generating deployment scripts in automated workflows
- CI/CD pipeline integration

## Current Option

PostgresCompare is available as a desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux. The desktop app provides full comparison, deployment script generation, and direct deployment capabilities.

To get started with the desktop application, see the [Installation Guide](/docs/getting-started/installation/).
