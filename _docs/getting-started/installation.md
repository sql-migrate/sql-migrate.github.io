PostgresCompare is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## System Requirements

PostgresCompare connects directly to your PostgreSQL databases, so you'll need:
- Network access to your PostgreSQL servers
- Valid database credentials with read permissions

## Installation

1. Download the zip file for your platform from [postgrescompare.com](https://postgrescompare.com)
2. Unzip the archive
3. Run PostgresCompare from the extracted folder

## First Launch

When you first launch PostgresCompare, you'll see the welcome screen where you can:

1. Create a new project
2. Open an existing project

If you have a license key, you can enter it in the application settings to unlock all features. Otherwise, you can use the trial to evaluate PostgresCompare.

## Next Steps

Once installed, you're ready to:

- [Create your first comparison](/docs/getting-started/quick-start/) - Connect to databases and compare schemas
- [Understanding results](/docs/getting-started/first-comparison/) - Learn what the comparison results mean
